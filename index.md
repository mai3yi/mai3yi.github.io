# **Commissions, Process, and Terms**

**Portfolio:** [mai3yi.com](https://mai3yi.com)  
**Contact:** [shrinivasmaitreyi@gmail.com](mailto:shrinivasmaitreyi@gmail.com)  
**Timezone:** EST  

## **How does this work?**  
*(& what you can expect from me)*  

### Step 1: Brief  
##### We go over your goals, references, scope, deadline, and budget.  

### Step 2: Quote & Deposit  
##### I send you a final quote + invoice, and you send 50% deposit to finalize your slot.  

### Step 3: Concepts  
##### I deliver thumbnails/moodboards, and you pick a direction from that. At this stage, I can accommodate big changes.

### Step 4: Revisions  
##### We make adjustments based on the revision limit you purchased, and I start working on the final product. 

### Step 5: Finals  
##### You approve the final, pay the balance, and I send you the promised deliverables. 


**Timelines**  
- **Concepts:** 3–7 days from deposit  
- **Full Delivery:** 2 weeks – 2+ months depending on complexity & revisions. I'll be very clear about the expected timeline, especially if it's a more complex piece. 
- **Rush Fees:** +40% fee for delivery ≤ 2 weeks from concept approval (step 3). (availability not guaranteed)  


**File Formats**  
- **2D:** PNG (300 DPI), JPG (web), PDF  
- **Vector:** SVG, PDF  
- **3D:** .blend/.fbx/.obj, textures (PNG) — FBX is **visual-use only**, not guaranteed to be game-ready.  
- **UI:** Layered Illustrator or PSD
- **ANIMATED:** Layered AE files with pre-compositions included, + original 2D files.
- **Color:** sRGB (web), CMYK/spot on request  


## **Terms & Policies**  

### Revisions  
- A “revision” = an adjustment to the chosen concept. In the same lane. (ex, an ocean scene -> an ocean scene with a submarine)
- A **new direction** = new concept and is billed separately.  (ex, an ocean scene -> a scifi scene)
- Batch feedback is faster; drip-feeding feedback will likely extend the timeline. 

### Rights & Licensing  
- Default: **Non-exclusive commercial license**. Exclusive rights can be discussed.
- [Exclusive means I won’t reuse or resell the design; non-exclusive means I may put it in my portfolio or use it for other purposes.]
- I keep rights to unused concepts and can show them in my portfolio.  
- NDAs must be requested before project start. Simple NDAs are free; complex/restrictive NDAs may incur an extra fee.  
- Source files for logos are included. Raw working files for other categories are add-ons unless agreed in advance.
- If you wish to purchase copyright, this can be discussed at any time during the process. 

### Payment  
- 50% deposit to start, 50% on approval before final delivery.
- Currency: USD preferred; EUR accepted via PayPal.  
- Late balance >14 days: 2% fee **per week** delayed.  

### Cancellations & Refunds  
- If you cancel **after** concepts are delivered: deposit is non-refundable. 
- If I cancel: you’ll be refunded in full for any work not yet delivered, and you will keep whatever I did deliver.

### Scope Changes & Hourly Work  
- Anything outside the agreed scope is billed at **$23/hr**. I will not add extra hours without informing you.
- Examples: new style direction after approval, extra variants, additional screens, texture rework, shaders, etc.
